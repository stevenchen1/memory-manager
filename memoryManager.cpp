/*
Project Requirements
Memory Pool Creation: Create a fixed-size memory pool that will serve as the source of dynamically allocated memory.
Memory Allocation Function: Implement a function to allocate memory blocks from the memory pool.
Memory Deallocation Function: Implement a function to deallocate memory blocks and return them to the memory pool.
Pointer Arithmetic: Use pointer arithmetic to navigate through the memory pool.
Error Handling: Handle cases where memory allocation fails due to insufficient memory.
Testing: Write a set of tests to ensure the memory management functions work correctly, including edge cases like double deallocation or out-of-bounds access.

Desired Output
A MemoryManager class with methods to allocate and deallocate memory.
A test suite that verifies the functionality and correctness of the MemoryManager class.
Detailed comments and documentation explaining how pointers are used in the implementation.
